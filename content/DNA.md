I have spent some years (and much money) DNA testing with all four major genealogical testing companies, Ancestry, 23andMe, MyHeritage, and FamilyTreeDNA.
(only the latter three provide actual DNA match data; Ancestry gives "black box" matches only.)

At this point, I can assign a little over 60% of total matrilineal DNA to specific ancestors.
