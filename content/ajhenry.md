I have a number of reasons to be suspicious of the identity of Grandma Gladys Potter's reported father, A J Henry.

First, there is no documentation of a Lore/Henry marriage.  Not dispositive, by itself. Certainly not considering the oil-rush in Western PA at the time.

Then, an overview of the Henry family tree (on FamilySearch.com for example) indicates that he was descended from a mostly-Irish lineage.  Since I am just as Irish as I expect to be (ca 45%).  My 
maternal first cousins who have tested on Ancestry.com are only "trace" Irish. At a great-grandfather level, Mr "Henry" 's family would have added 12-13% Irish-origin DNA.  It is apparently not there.

Furthermore, Mr. Henry was part of a large family with many living descendants today.  I find no matches, nor do my maternal first cousins.  Not dispositive, again, because people test or not.

Finally, if Glady's mother was simply fishing for a name to provide for a marriage license for her daughter in 1909, Mr. Henry (who was the right age, local, respectable, and had died in 1907) would have been pretty much ideal. 
     "Right age" in that, born in 1868, he would have been around 20 in 1888 to do the deed.
     "Local" in that Mr. Henry died in Butler, PA, but had earlier lived in Perry, Armstrong County, PA about 40 miles from Oil City, PA, quite possibly with rail connections at the time.  
     "Respectable" in the Mr. Henry had been a physician.
     "Dead" of pneumonia on 28 December 1907, listed "Single".

Perhaps, somewhat charitably, this could have been a "Mama Mia" scenario, so just pick a guy..
