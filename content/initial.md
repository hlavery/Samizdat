This website contains some genealogical thoughts, mostly for myself.

I am Hugh (Potter) Lavery and may be contacted at hlavery dot protonmail dot com (remove dots)

After an ititial post to preserve some of my past work, I then will think through what I know thus far about my Potter family tree and DNA.
