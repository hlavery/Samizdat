I put much thought and effort into two websites that preserve some family letters and documents.
For various reasons, the original websites may not be stable long-term.
The larger site is (originally) a Wordpress blog hosted on GoDaddy. The Wordpress program updates continually, and may one day break my site.
Also, GoDaddy has a strong preference for getting paid.  


First, we have a static (HTML pages only, no Wordpress magic) version of Mom's saved letters to 1943:

[Gladys Potter's Family](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPJjQ6w4BUY3Ly6efkp76jvGqjx5keMN7SRzGuPFMgHrR)

Then, a static version of my Dad's World War II letters, originally hlavery.xyz...which is already a static site, but if the name no longer works (i.e., because I omitted paying the rental thereof) here is an alternative:

[WII Letters of Hugh H Lavery](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmc26qoy4qe2xT4PNTxnR8EyXEfaK3XQWEXRo4nC5C1GM7)
