First, we have a static (HTML pages only, no Wordpress magic)

[Gladys Potter's Family](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPJjQ6w4BUY3Ly6efkp76jvGqjx5keMN7SRzGuPFMgHrR)

Then, a static version of my Dad's World War II letters, originally hlavery.xyz...which is already a static site, but if the name no longer works (i.e., because I omitted paying the rental thereof)

[WII Letters of Hugh H Lavery[(https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmc26qoy4qe2xT4PNTxnR8EyXEfaK3XQWEXRo4nC5C1GM7)
