My family tree is pretty well filled out, with the exception of great-grandfather "Andrew Henry" which was the name Grandma gave for her father, presumably as related to her by Alice Lore.  There is no record of a Henry/Lore marriage. Alice later married Henry Perry, so for some of Grandma's youth she was known as "Gladys Perry."  The parentage talk between Gladys and her mom Alice must have been something to have heard.

The following copy of the tree has been marked-up to show inheritance patterns of autosomal, X-DNA, and mitochondrial DNA.
What this shows is that I could expect to see half my DNA from paternal sources, and half from maternal..of which 25% would be from (Potter/Hasbrouck lines) plus 12.5% from (unknown "Henry" ancestors) plus 12.5% from (Lore/Davis lines.)
There is some chance of X-chromosome matches with "Andrew Henry's" mother and maternal grandparents.  Mitochondrial MtDNA is not relevant to the identity of Mr. Henry
